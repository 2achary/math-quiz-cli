# Python Math Quiz
A timed math quiz in python with a CLI
Each question is timed and once an answer
is provided, there is instant feedback 
as to whether it was right or wrong. 

Once all the questions have been answered, 
there is a summary of each questions correctness,
the average time per question and total time of 
quiz.

This project demonstrates the ability to manipulate
date and time objects in Python, creating a CLI, and
clean modular, testable code. There are unittests
included in the repo.
